      <h2>What is corruption?</h2>
      <p>The most common definition of corruption is misuse of office or power for personal gain. A wider definition is that corruption is abuse of trust. There are two possible approaches to defining corruption: based on laws or based on public opinion.
        The definition based on laws is guided by what corruption is considered to be in legislation, while the definition based on public opinion is guided by the wider opinion of the public as a whole. Corruption occurs in all three sectors: the private,
        the public and the third sector. A case where a store’s Purchase Manager gets a bribe from a manufacturer to display preference to that manufacturer’s products is corruption in the private sector, as the Purchase Manager abuses his position and
        causes harm to the company. Another example of corruption in the private sector is when an undertaking conducting supervision gets a favour for being biased in their supervision or for conducting no supervision at all.</p>
